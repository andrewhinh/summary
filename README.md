Automated YouTube Video Transcription and Summarization!

# How to use
1. Go to the Google Colab link here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PgzSwMcE37H40MrR5ztcKCAa_iy8mkG7?usp=sharing
2. Make a copy by going to the `File` Tab and clicking the `Save a copy in Drive` button.
3. In the `Change this` sub-section, change the youtube link associated with the `youtube_video_link` variable to the YouTube video link of your choice.
4. Click the play button under the `Summary: Take notes automatically!` section, and forget ever taking notes again as your summary appears under the `Take my Notes!` section! (Depending on how long your video is, this might take a while: a 9.5min video takes about 19.5 mins, for reference.)
5. Realize AI and ML isn't perfect, and fix the transcription with Grammarly afterwards.
